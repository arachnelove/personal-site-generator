#Stuff to implement for the site generator

* should take a folder name as input
* should search recursively for... files? in markdown, maybe with metadata
* should do markdown to html conversion, prob with discount
* should have base boilerplate/template/whatever
* should support general assets/static files - css, js, etc

* metadata support, like tags
* plugins - via scripting? pipes? - to affect output
