#Stuff to implement for the site generator

* should take a folder name as input
* should search recursively for... files? in markdown, maybe with metadata
* should do markdown to html conversion, prob with discount
* should have base boilerplate/template/whatever
* should support general assets/static files - css, js, etc
* need to think precisely about linking and page paths - should prob be learned from tags? or sep logic? plus what about links, are they via id??? input filename???

* metadata support, like tags
* plugins - via scripting? pipes? - to affect output
* print stats after parsing - unconnected pages, tags discovered, etc
* clientside fulltext search??? maybe w/ webasm???

* tests lmao
